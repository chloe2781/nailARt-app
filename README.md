# nailARt
====================

An app that leverages augmented reality technology to provide a more accurate and convenient way of selecting nail designs.
This app will allow users to preview different designs on their own hands in real-time through the use of their phone camera.

## Why does it matter?

The problem that this app aims to solve is the difficulty in choosing and visualizing nail designs. Many people struggle to imagine how a particular design would look on their nails, making the selection process challenging by having to spend so much time and money on finding and doing nail sets that came out very different than expectations. With this app, users can eliminate the guesswork and make more informed decisions by seeing the designs on their own hands in real-time.

## Benefits?

The app will benefit the target audience by making the process of choosing nail designs easier and more enjoyable. It saves time and eliminates the need for physical try-ons, making it more convenient and sustainable for users (a nail set that lasts for 3-4 weeks could cost ~ $50-$500). By providing a real-time preview, users can adjust or choose different designs with ease, leading to a more satisfying experience in selecting and visualizing nail designs. This is made to save time, money, and effort.

## About

I'm Chloe and I do nails for fun now (used to be professionally). As I spend so much time doing and designing nails, it's very often to hate the vision that I have for a set of nails after it's done. Similarly, my friends and customers felt the same way after they have their set done because so many things could go wrong (same shape different length look differently on different hands, just to start with). I needed a solution to be more sustainable to pursue  my love for nail art, and here it is, NailARt (get it cuz AR in art :) )

Architecture Planning: Plan the development architecture, including the design of the augmented reality feature.

Week 3-4:
Development: Start developing the app's user interface (using Balsamiq/Figma) for lo-fi and hi-fi prototypes, ensuring it is user-friendly and intuitive.

Week 5-6:
Development: Implement the augmented reality feature and ensure it is functioning correctly.

Week 7-8:
Testing: Begin testing the app's functionality, including testing the augmented reality feature and fixing any bugs that are discovered.

Week 9-10:
Development: Complete the app's development, including the addition of any remaining features.

Week 11-12:
Testing: Perform final quality assurance testing, ensuring that all features are functioning correctly.

Week 13:
Present: Present my progress and the app/website.
